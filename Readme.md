# Ontology
The Transmodel Ontology is being developed to allow for the representation of data according to the CEN Reference Data Model for Public Transport. 

It is divided into a set of modules in order to make it more maintainable, namely:
* Module XXX. In this module we represent XXXX
* Module YYY. In this module we represent XXXX

The ontology will be published in: https://w3id.org/transmodel/ (soon more details on the naming strategy)
